# ClassVolumeSilencer
IDEA: ever seen someone accidentally blare out a video during class? Yeah, that was me today during anthropology. Let's try and fix that by automatically turning down the volume during hours that the user can prescribe.

No commits yet, I'll hop to it sometime. The idea is it'll just be a command line tool where you pass in a csv
with all your classes written in some standard format, and it can handle the rest for you. 
Additional mode idea: sound down at first class, sound up at last class VS sound down at start of class, sound up at end of class.
